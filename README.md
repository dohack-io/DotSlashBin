Your helping hand for problems with garbage.

## Description 
TrashHero is a Web-App where you can report full trash bins in your near and get information what kind of waste belongs to which trash bin. 

## Built with
We built it with the power of jQuery, SASS, Bootstrap, Google Maps and Directus.

## What benefit will your work bring in smart city context?
TrashHero ensures that the garbage is better separated and that the planning of garbage collection intervals is optimized by real-time information. This saves exhaust fumes and reduces idling.

## What were challenges you encountered and Lessons Learned?
Some team members have programmed a web app for the first time or worked for the first time with Frameworks or Tools like jQuery, Bootstrap, Sass & Git. Due to this imbalance there were some barriers, but because we were motivated and focused, we were able to master them all.

## Anything to add?
Of course you can extend the concept a lot. Mainly in terms of content where which bin is located or where which garbage should be disposed of.
